# 🧠 LLM from Scratch — Python Implementation

This repository contains a **from-scratch implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM)** in Python.  
It is inspired by the YouTube lecture series:  
🎥 **[“LLM from Scratch” – Complete Lecture Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPTV0NXA_ZSgsLAr8YCgCwhPIJNNtexWu)**  

The project demonstrates how transformer-based language models are built and function internally — from the lowest-level components to a working text generator. It focuses on **clarity, readability, and conceptual understanding** rather than performance or dataset size.

## 📚 Overview

This implementation walks through the **core components** that define modern LLMs:
- Tokenization for converting text into numerical sequences  
- Embedding layers to map tokens into continuous vector space  
- Positional encoding for order awareness  
- Self-attention mechanism to capture relationships within sequences  
- Feed-forward layers for feature transformation  
- Transformer block combining attention and feed-forward modules  
- Output head for autoregressive text generation  

Everything is built step by step in a single Python file to ensure full transparency and learning value.

## 📺 Reference

This implementation is based on concepts taught in the YouTube series:  
**[LLM from Scratch – Complete Lecture Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPTV0NXA_ZSgsLAr8YCgCwhPIJNNtexWu)**  
The series provides a structured and practical explanation of how large language models work at their core.
